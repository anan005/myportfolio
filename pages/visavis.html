            <span>Research and insight about target group</span>

            <p>
                Aftenposten is Norway's largest subscription newspaper 
                with just over 250,000 subscriptions (per 2018), where more 
                than 115,000 are pure digital subscriptions. Aftenposten is 
                working to develop quality journalism and products that give 
                subscribers insight and knowledge to participate in the social 
                debate and strengthen democracy. Aftenposten's business model is 
                based on sales of subscriptions and ads. As of today, ads account 
                for about 30% of revenue.  
            </p>


            <p>
                In order to form a picture of the target group's needs, we prepared
                qualitative and quantitative surveys. For the quantitative surveys,
                we used google forms. We intentionally did not ask direct questions 
                about Aftenposten, nor mentioning news in general. This was to avoid 
                affecting the answers from the respondents, and get more genuine answers.
            </p>


            <p class="bold">
                The quantitative surveys consist of 5 parts:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Part 1: Personal interests and demographics. Here we map age, place
                    of residence, gender, occupation, interests and which social
                    media they used
                </li>

                <li>
                    Part 2: Habits and relationships with news. Which news sources they 
                    used, on type of device, the interested in news, and type of 
                    situations they would typically read news, like time and place.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Part 3: User experience. What does it typically take for you to click 
                    on a case? Do you prefer to read only text, listen, watch video 
                    or a combination?
                </li>

                <li>
                    Part 4: Here we knew screenshots of the day's front page at
                    Dagbladet, VG, Nrk, Nettavisen and Aftenposten, respectively. In the 
                    screenshots, we left out logos and other things that revealed 
                    which image belonged to which newspaper. We asked them to tell us what 
                    feelings the different front pages aroused in them.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Part 5: Specifically in the traditional Norwegian newspapers. 
                    Here we asked them to describe their trust in the big media houses, 
                    which they possibly trusted more than the others, and what they 
                    wanted to see more of in the newspapers.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <img src="../img/visavis/5_quant-survey.jpg" alt="" width="600px">

            <p class="bold">
                Quality interviews: 
            </p>

            <p>
                We also conduct 4 qualitative interviews where we met the participants 
                face to face. The questions went under the same topics as in the
                surveys, but as well having the opportunity to ask more direct questions
                to clarify the interview subjects news habits, what they perceived as
                interesting and unnecessary, that may cause friction points in the 
                user's experience, what typically made them click on a case, what 
                intrigued them to read the whole article, and what relation they had 
                to the pictures of various front pages.
            </p>


            <p>
                We found in the surveys that some of the most important for the
                target group was loyalty and fairness. We also found that clickbait, 
                scandal and tabloid headlines could most likely make them feel 
                overwhelmed. But while a good overview, serious journalism, good photo 
                and easy readability caused interest.

            <span>Personas</span>

            <p>Based on the surveys, we created 3 different personas</p>

            <img src="../img/visavis/7_personas.jpeg" alt="" width="500px">


            <span>Concept</span>

            <p>
                After determining the target group's needs and values, we were 
                ready to pitch ideas for the concept. We focused on how we could 
                create a solution that combines the needs from the client and the 
                target group. So to create something that is accessible, easy to 
                read, factual and relevant so they can get more readers between 
                18-25 years.
            </p>

            <img src="../img/visavis/8_research_values.png" alt="" width="600px">

            <p>
                We were aware that clickbait and unimportant news are something
                that was less important to the target group, and that the scepticism
                for downloading an app is relatively high. The solution we wanted to
                create should respond to the ever-increasing gap between traditional
                newspapers and young readers. It should be interactive, inclusive,
                engaging for young adults. It should also promote the importance of
                knowledge and exchange of opinions that can prevent polarisation and
                echo chambers. Early in the process, Fredrik brought in the four
                “cardinal virtues” as something we could be inspired by onward.
            </p>

            <p>
                We began the idea development by sparring about these goals of ours 
                with the product. Then everyone brainstormed on their own edge, 
                before we gathered the proposals and tried to put it together
            </p>

            <img src="../img/visavis/9_analyses.jpg" alt="" width="500px">

            <p>
                Realising that our idea made it too complexed, we decided to
                focus only on MVP, minimal viable product (empathy, usable, reliable, 
                functional). So we agreed on an app where Aftenposten facilitates
                debates, and everyone can listen and participate for free. In this 
                way, we took care of the values as accessibility and inclusion.     
            </p>

            <p>
                It was at this time that we came up with the name of the app: vis-à-vis

            <span>User Experience & flowchart</span>

            <p>
                When we worked with flow charts, we spent some time specifying 
                what the app should contain and how the user should navigate through. 
                The first flow chart we made looked like this:
            </p>

            <img src="../img/visavis/11_flowchart-before.jpg" alt="" width="800px">

            <p>
                We also formulated three different user journeys to make it clear to 
                ourselves which needs and functional zones the app should cover
            </p>

            <p>
                During the work, we realised that the app we planned for would be too 
                comprehensive, and it made us rethink the content. We chose to exclude 
                latest news feeds with articles, which the online newspaper Aftenposten 
                already offers, because we wanted to make more room for the debating 
                platform. Therefore we agreed to only focusing on debates, with relevant 
                articles as "aid". The thematic categories for the debate were also 
                removed,  leaving the app only having ongoing, upcoming and past debates. 
                Archive for earlier debates and articles will have a limited time 
                availability.
            </p>

            <p>
                We made a new flow chart where we had stripped away the functions we 
                no longer saw as necessary, and that made it much easier to move forward 
                in the process.

                conclusion that ongoing, upcoming and previous debates 
                should have visual elements that separate them from each 
                other, at the same time as we want the app to look holistic
