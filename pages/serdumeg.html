        <span>Research of charity and sub-themes</span>

            <p>
                This helpline has existed since 1984, and there 
                is around 160 volunteers in Norway today. As well 
                a part of the large Global network Child Helpline 
                International.
            </p>

            <a href="https://korspaahalsen.rodekors.no/om-oss/">korspaahalsen.rodekors.no/om-oss</a>

            <img src="../img/serdumeg/4_research-kph.png" alt="" width="500px">

            <p class="bold">
                Selected sub-themes we wanted to highlight in the campaign:
            </p>

            <ul>

                <li>- Child abuse</li>
                <li>- Bullying</li>
                <li>- Suicide</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
                The reason we choosing these themes is to highlight the most
                common issues and questions from the children. These are serious 
                topics that are important to present how serious and relevant 
                those are in the lives of children and youth, in a respectable 
                way. 
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
                Child neglect and child abuse is often divided into 4 categories:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Mental abuse
                </li>

                <li>
                    - Physical abuse
                </li>

                <li>
                    - Absence of actions, in the form of physical<br>
                    and emotional neglect and neglect.
                </li>

                <li>
                    - Other types of violence against children (bullying,<br>
                    witnesses of violence or violence in close relationships.)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Child abuse and neglect are performed by definition of the
                caregiver(s), as the person(s) who is responsible for the care. 
                Caregivers can be parents, foster parents, staff at child welfare 
                institutions, but also coaches or others who have temporary care for 
                the child. The definition of children in this context ranges from 0-18 years.

        <span>Target group</span>

            <p>The target group consists of a broad group of people ranging from 22 to 65+ years.
                What they have in common is that they are all concerned with the everyday lives of 
                children and young people, that they thrive in their surroundings and those around 
                them. They are empathetic towards the upbringing of children and young people, and 
                want to make a difference for those who fall outside a safe environment and framework. 
                This is a group of people who, on the basis of this, are engaged in charitable and 
                voluntary work for organizations that work with specific goals and issues.
            </p>

        <span>Personas</span>

            <p>
                We created 3 different personas who matches the description of the target group.
            </p>

        <span>Concept and text content</span>

            <p class="bold">
                Focusing on the sub-themes, we decided to create three fictive 
                stories about a child or youth, based on related theme.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
                Espen:
            </p>

            <p>
                This Is Espen, he is 9 years old. Espen is not like other child at school. 
                He has recently moved from his hometown and started a new school, and he 
                had a different dialect than the other children. Everyday, he worries about 
                walking to school, because of the other children who makes fun of his dialect. 
                Every time it rains the older children at the school throws his backpack 
                in the puddle.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
                Tobias:
            </p>

            <p>
                It rumbles in the stomach of Tobias who after a long day at school is hungry, 
                but there's no dinner at the table. There is nothing to find for Tobias in the 
                fridge, it is almost empty and much of the food has gone wrong. This is not 
                the first time Tobias didn't receive dinner or find any food to eat at home. 
                Mother rarely cooks or takes care of the home, she often sleeps on the sofa 
                while watching loud TV in the background.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
                Nora:
            </p>

            <p>
                It's getting late and Nora is always worried when it gets dark outside. 
                This means that she has to be alone in the room with herself and her 
                thoughts. The last years in high school was not that easy, as well she was 
                told she had to repeat the last year again. She hasn't had the courage to 
                tell anyone that she has felt lonely and sad for a few years, so no one at
                school or at home understands how she actually really felt.
            </p>

            <p class="bold">
                Facts based on statistics:
            </p>

            <p>
                Espen is only 1 in 26,652 children in Norway who experience and live with 
                some form of bullying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tobias is only 1 in 52,862 children in Norway who experience child neglecting 
                in one degree or more.

            </p>
            <p>
                Nora is not alone, almost 298,009 out of 895,026 young people in Norway 
                have thoughts about suicide.

                Who are we? We are three students from Interaction Design at Kristiania 
                University College. We have been tasked with creating a campaign website 
                for a chosen purpose. We chose to create a campaign for Kors på halsen, 
                an anonymous helpline service for children and youth up to the age of 18.
