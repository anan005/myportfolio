        <span>Research - Target Group</span>

            <p>
                I first started mapping the research process so I 
                could get a better overview of who i needed to interview.
                Since this war during the pandemic of covid-19,
                and the city was under lock-down, there was unfortunate
                not so many visitors in Oslo at the moment. So I jumped
                to a conclusion of making the primary target group with
                tourists but as well people who lives in the city but is not
                originally from Oslo.
                So to gather most data as possible I made quantity interviews
                by using Google Forms to create the surveys. I got 15
                responses in English version, and 4 in Norwegian.
            </p>

            <img src="../img/oslonaa/3_survey.png" alt="" width="700px">

            <p>
                The target group consist of a group of people  aged 20-65
                years old. They have more or less have some knowledge about
                Oslo already, because they have either friends or family located
                in the city, or because they live or have lived there themselves.
                On their spare time, and sometimes in work relations, they want
                to be able to discover cultural events in the city, where they
                will have the opportunity to socialize, learn new things and get
                to know new people with the same interests, hopefully with 
                some locals.
            </p>

        <span>Personas</span>

            <p>
                We created 3 different personas who matches the description of the target group.
            </p>

            <img src="../img/oslonaa/4_personas.png" alt="" width= "500px">


        <span>Concept</span>

            <p>
                After the research, and collecting the common issue and
                interests about the target group the first idea that
                came to me was creating a product that could help people
                integrate to the social environment and culture in Oslo,
                as a way to also meet local people from the city. 
                As well exploring the beautiful nature, fjord and the old
                attractions at the same time. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Since the concept is about getting updates in current time,
                is chose to give it a name that was not only easy to remember,
                but to also lift the concepts identity and function; Oslo Nå,
                'nå' as in 'now'.

            <p>
                The feedbacks from the lo-fi user testing showed that the
                buttons on top was distracting, and made it look messy. 
                Solving by making a navigation button on top, 
                including the actions instead.

        <span>Moodboard</span>

            <p>
                For the visual identity, I got inspired by the one
                Oslo adopted in 2019. The colours they have used
                in their palette are inspiration from the landscape in
                the city itself, to the fjord and forest, and everything
                in between. The municipality have their own font as well,
                called Oslo Sans, this was inspired by the many generations of
                street signs in the city, therefore I choose a
                humanist “sans-serif”, Open Sans.

        <span>About Oslo Nå</span>

        <p class="bold">FUNCTIONS</p>

        <p>
            I wanted to apply English as a primary language,
            since I wanted to keep the idea of creating a product
            for tourists who mainly don't speak the main language.
            But I also added Norwegian for the ones who wants to
            learn the language, and also for the Norwegian users
            who don't understand English that well.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            A search bar will be available to save time if the user
            already know or wants something specific. 
        </p>

        <p class="bold">ACTIVITIES</p>

        <p>
            Common interests from the target group.            
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Art</li>
            <li>Concert</li>
            <li>Dance perfomance</li>
            <li>Market</li>

            <li>Stand-Up/Open-Mic</li>
            <li>Theatre</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="bold">THE EVENTS</p>

        <p>
            After finding an activity, all the events will show up in
            current time, from top to bottom, can also change time
            and date if necessary. The list contains events and short
            important information about it, like the name of event,
            but also time and place, to get better overview.
        </p>

        <p class="bold">MORE INFORMATION ABOUT EVENT</p>

        <p>
            A small introduction of the event will
            inform the user about what the event is about, 
            with link to redirect you to official event page.
            Or they can scroll down the page for more detailed
            information.
        </p>

        <p>
            If the user is satisfied and interested on going to
            event, they can directly click on the "take me there
            now"-button.
